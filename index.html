        <b><span class="code">Object- Oriented Programming and Abstraction</span></b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>According to Wikipedia, Object-Oriented Programming, also known as OOP "...is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of 'this'). In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] There is significant diversity in object-oriented programming, but most popular languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determines their type."
        </p>
        <p>In Python, programmers use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/contents.html">the Python Standard Library</a> as the foundation for creating abstract templates. The Python Standard Library is an extensive list of modules with hyperlinks that explain all the functions and classes available in Python. Basically the Python Standard Library (PSL) is a library of endless objects and how they interact together to create a program. In some cases the library provides solutions to programming-problem scenarios.  Abstract thinking is an integral part of Object-Oriented Programming, OOP, because it can take a function that has a set of features. These attributes create more space for programming beyond what the programmer is typing.   In Python there is code and data that interact to create an object.  These objects are class instances that can have extensive attributes.  The objects interact with each other.</p>
        <p> 
        For example a function such as webbrowser.open is a simple function because it performs the activity in the typing of the function explicitly.  Then there are functions such as the module turtle that have Classes inside the function, such as Turtle.  The class Turtle has a subset of activities associated with it, which are listed in the Python Standard Library.  Suddenly the programmer has enhanced dimension of space and movement simply by utilizing the class.  A whole set of features are associated in the class Turtle. Hence, these attributes create the abstract space within OOP.</p>
        <p>Object-Oriented Programming has advantages.  Since it is based on modules, any time programming updates and changes need to be made it can be done at the modular level, not by changing the entire program with numerous corrections.  This saves time in the long-term. Examples of modules covered in the course are: Webbrowser, Time, OS, URLlib, and then the function URLopen inside URLLib. Second, OOP code is reusable, which means shorter, software development time and the code created already can be used for future projects. During the course we used the classes Turtle, as well as the init-like functions of open(file) and urllib.urlopen.  The last two were more inherent because the functions had to be called (returned) to show their class function. The classes with attributes means there is a library of extensive objects to choose from for a project.  And whatever is created can be used for future use.</p>

        <b>Classes</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>As mentioned, another interesting feature about Object-Oriented Programming, OOP is that it contains <b><span class="code"> classes. </span></b>  A class can have several functions contained within the class, along with data.  Then there is a dot to give the function an operation to perform in Python.  The class can have a set of activities inside its organized structure.  This space is the abstract part of OOP.  When a programmer uses a class, and initiates it, then it creates an <b>instance</b> inside Python, otherwise known as an object of that class.  
       </p>
        <p>
        For example in the class Professor Kunal utilized class.Turtle to create a yellow square called Brad and a blue circle called Angie. Brad and Angie were objects of the class.  Turtle, which is a class file contained within the module turtle, contained operations for color, shape, movement, and speed.  The end result of going to the module turtle, accessing the file Turtle within the folder, and tapping the initiate Python file within Turtle, were class instances; and in this example, the instance objects were called Brad and Angie.
        </p>
        <p>Instructor Kunal explained class is like a blueprint because it gives the details of the number and the size of the potential object to be created by the code. Class is like the folder within the the business plan for an organization. The class folder contains an outline of directives and each of the directives will have a subset of function-files, which need to be initiated in the space of the organization. Some of the function-files are self-explanatory; for example, the activity, stay within budget, because the function-files explains what should happen in the end result. However more detailed functions-files, increase productivity in IT-development by 25 % will have classes of activities to create the end result determined by the class itself.</p>
       <p>
       In programming, when the classes are initiated they are considered class instances or objects.  An example Instructor Kunal explained was <em> rest.TwilioRestClient():</em>.  Twilio was the folder downloaded to the laptop and insider was the rest folder.  Inside rest has a python file for the rest client. The parentheses indicate to tap the initiate function.  Both Turtle and Twilio are like wooden Babushka/Stacking/Nesting Dolls.  Start with the large directory doll to initiate the next class of doll inside and her set of features files; and then go to the next doll inside to see what her folder contains and initiate her classes. Each doll has classes and data, which expands to more abstract space and memory.

        <b>Making Classes Through<b><span class="code"> Instance Variables </span></b> and <span class="code">Instance Methods </span></b> 
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>Instructor Kunal continued with the concept of making classes through the building of a movies web site.  Earlier in the course we were introduced to the class Turtle and instances of those classes were Brad and Angie.  In the movies' website, adding movies to the website are instances of the class Movie. Through the exercise we continued building on what we learned in the previous exercises. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We created a python file called media and a separate file called entertainment center. Then he imported the media file into the entertainment center file. The class Movie had the <b> def_init_</b> function called within Python, which creates space and memory in Python. Init also is another instance inside the class movie.  Def_init is also called a <em>constructor,</em> after which he typed the word <b>self.</b> Then he typed the word self, which is a class name Python keyword.  The init_function took the variables title, storyline, poster image, and youtube trailer to remember inside the class Movie.  Self is an instance object.  All of the items associated with self instance/object are called instance variables because use of the function self creates the instance variables. When we use def show-trailer this is called a function or an instance method because we initialize the init function. When we use webbrowser.open the movie is the instance variable and using self within an instance is called an instance method.   
        </p>
        <p>Finally, Instructor Kunal explained more advanced concepts in OOP, such as inheritance.  When class Parent is created and it has a class Child, the class Child will inherit attributes within class Parent.  For example, the Instructor define an instance method called show_info inside class Parent.  And then instances within class Child can inherit the Parent's instance method even though show-info was not originally an attribute of class Child.  When the subset class uses attributes it inherited from the parent class; this is called Method Overriding.
